== Welcome to Poliverse

Poliverse is an application to track, follow and keep a watchful eye on politicians.

== Developers

The code is still under development and changes will occur quite frequently. If something isn't working please add an 
issue and we'll investigate. Some things are simply not working and will be addressed as quickly as possible. All feedback is welcome. 

== Installation and Setup

"fastercsv" is used for the population task:
  
  gem install fastercsv

Poliverse is a Ruby on Rails application. As such, you'll need a recent version (2.3.5+):

  gem install rails -v 2.3.5
  
Poliverse strives to allow you to use whichever database suits your needs. You'll need a recent version of the MySQL, 
PostgreSQL, etc. drivers:

  gem install mysql 
  
  or
  
  gem install postgres
  
  or 
  
  gem install [your database driver]
  
  
You should then be able to run rake:gems:install which should install all of the other dependencies:

  rake gems:install
